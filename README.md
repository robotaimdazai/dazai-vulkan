# Status
I've spent good amount of time learning Vulkan API, implemented complete redndering flow with a 2d water simulation.
I've decided to pause this project as it needs too much boilerplate code, will resume once I'm bottlenecked by OpenGL.

# Completed
- renderer abstraction
- 2D renderer
# Future Planned Features
- 3d renderer
- physics engine
- ECS
- Deferred rendering
- demo game ??
